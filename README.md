# Smart Contract Security Analysis Platform

An enterprise-grade platform for detecting vulnerabilities in smart contracts with high performance and accuracy.

## Overview

This platform combines machine learning and static analysis techniques to identify security vulnerabilities in smart contracts. It's designed for high throughput, low latency, and enterprise-level reliability.

## Key Features

- **Modular Detection Pipeline**: Pluggable feature extractors and detectors
- **Distributed Analysis**: Auto-scaling Slither workers with priority-based queuing
- **Performance Optimizations**: SIMD-accelerated feature calculations and sliding window caches
- **Production Safeguards**: Circuit breakers, canary deployments, and dark launch capabilities
- **Continuous Improvement**: A/B testing framework and quality metrics tracking

## Architecture

The system consists of several key components:
- API Gateway for request handling
- Priority Queue for workload management
- Detection Pipeline for vulnerability analysis
- Distributed Slither workers for static analysis
- Metrics collection for performance monitoring

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Detection (6 Weeks)
- Implement compiler version compatibility checks
- Add sliding window cache with TTL
- Build storage layout analysis

### Phase 2: Distributed Analysis (4 Weeks)
- Implement auto-scaling Slither workers
- Add priority-based processing queue
- Develop cold/warm path optimization

### Phase 3: Performance Tuning (3 Weeks)
- Add SIMD-optimized feature calculations
- Implement batch processing mode
- Optimize critical paths

### Phase 4: Production Readiness (3 Weeks)
- Add circuit breaker pattern for ML models
- Implement dark launch capability
- Create canary deployment pipeline
